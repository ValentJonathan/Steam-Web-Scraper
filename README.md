# Steam-Web-Scraper
Web Scraping is one of the techniques that can be used to extract information from web pages. It is an useful techniques to gain relevant information from webpages quickly without manually searching for it. 
In this project I have decided to write a code to record Steam prices for games and scrape some relevant information about as I have noticed that somehow when I open Steam, my wallet becomes a little lighter. Thus by writing this code hopefully i can manage my finance more wisely and by tracking the prices I can decide when to buy or not. 

For this code, I have used Cyberpunk 2077 as the base game, but the link can be replaced by any game.
